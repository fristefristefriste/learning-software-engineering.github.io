## Resources for User Experience domain

### Overview

User experience is a large and broad topic. It covers the overall experience of the user and how they interact with software systems and applications. The confusing part is that UI and UX design, while related can also be totally different. For example, UI could be how the interface is designed whereas UX is more about how users interact with the said design.
There are many notable links differentiating the two areas. Here is one of the related websites.

### Areas of User Experience

User Experience is not easy to define. There are many areas that contribute to User Experience but there is not one answer. The following are a few examples.

___Button Design___ 
- [Amazon Button](https://medium.com/@cccalibour/how-ux-design-makes-a-difference-amazons-continue-button-901618a8b00e): The design of butt
ons that improves user experience by simplifying process.

___Established Norms___
- [Scrolls On Socials](https://forgeandsmith.com/blog/scrolling-vs-clicking-whats-the-preferred-user-experience/): Users are conditioned for scrolling, and now every new social media app conforms to scrolling.

___Color Theory___
- [Colors Influence Choice](https://usabilitygeek.com/colour-user-experience-psychology/#:~:text=Colour%20plays%20a%20crucial%20role,and%20identified%20with%20your%20industry.): Users are shown certain colors to enforce actions. For example, red is commonly linked to aggressive or bad emotions and as such can be used as a cancel to dissuade people from refunding items.

### A Brief Summary of Common UX Principles

#### Accessibility
Accessibility is a concept that encapsulates one central idea: to allow all users to easily enjoy and use applications. In common usage, it can refer to users with temporary or permanent disabilities (visual, motor, auditory, etc.), but is broader than this, referring also to overall robustness and operability (i.e. is the workflow too complicated? Can multiple devices access the application, if it is a web application?). Consideration for varying degrees of ability is fundamental to designâ€”a product should reach as wide of an audience as possible. Oftentimes, accesibility considerations lead to unintended benefits. For example, providing closed captioning on web video content can improve SEO indexing.

[Here](https://uxdesign.cc/accessibility-guidelines-for-a-ux-designer-c3ba775539be) is more comprehensive guide touching on various components of an application, particularly geared for web design.

Some concrete examples of this concept:
- Screen readers can make heavy use of [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_accessibility.asp) tags: for instance, someone operating a device using voice recognition uses a screen reader that can identify what can be clicked based on whether they are labelled as buttons. Alternate text for images is used by these to describe the content of an image to a user who cannot see it.
- Sufficient colour contrast and distinction between typeface sizes is helpful for users with low vision.
- Animation: content on an application should avoid animations that is a common trigger for seizures, which is high-contrast flashing for more than 3 times per second.


#### Hierarchy
Hierarchy, is the use of scale, contrast, typography, proximity, HTML structure, and colour to rank and highlight elements in an application in a certain order, such as importance. 

[Here](https://uxengineer.com/principles-of-design/hierarchy/) is a guide that goes into a deeper dive on each use case.

Hierarchy can be visual, for instance, using a larger and bolder font size for titles vs. paragraph text. It can also be structural; something understood by devices like screen readers. In HTML, one can label the former as a title using a header tag, and the latter using a paragraph tag.

#### Learnability
Learnability is all about the ease of use of a product. For someone who has never seen the product before, can they easily navigate the application and correctly figure out what to do with minimal difficulty? Users tend to not want to invest significant time and effort into most applications that they use, leading to abandonment. 

To make this concept more concrete, here are some examples of improvements to the learnability of an application:
- Onboarding: for complex applications with many features, it is necessary to present a new user with a brief view of features and walkthrough of a workflow.
- Simple navigation: avoiding complex, nested layouts, and using a full navigation bar when possible.
- Context: adding tooltips, helpful videos, or tutorials as an option can enhance how a user understands an application.

[Here](https://www.justinmind.com/blog/learnability-ux-design/) is an article that goes into more depth about learnability as a UX heuristic.

### Helpful Courses

There are many courses related to User Experience. This includes the U of T Course [The Design of Interactive Computational Media](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/csc318h1) which is highly recommended if interested in this topic. [The Design of Interactive Computational Media](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/csc318h1) expands on the work done before coding projects. For example, one of the projects is testing how users would interact with a prototype of a UI and modifying it so that the UX is better for the user.
